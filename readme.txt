Greetings,

This is a pure-PHP memcached client. Pure PHP means that you won't be needing any
PHP extensions (.dll's or .so's to use memcached). Sure the extensions will be
probably much faster for production setups, but I didn't manage to quickly find
any compiled extensions for Windows, so I coded this library and decided to share it.

xslib-memcached is part of xslib PHP-framework, which will be released at some point
in the future.
